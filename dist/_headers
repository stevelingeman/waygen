# 1. HTML Files - Do NOT cache (or cache very briefly)
# This ensures users always get the latest version of your app (which points to new hashed assets)
/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate

# 2. Static Assets (JS, CSS, Images in assets folder) - Cache FOREVER
# Vite generates filenames with content hashes (e.g., index.a1b2c3.js)
# If the file changes, the name changes, so it's safe to cache these indefinitely.
