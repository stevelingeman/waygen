## 🎯 Overview

Waygen simplifies the process of creating precise waypoint missions for drone photogrammetry. Users can draw survey boundaries, configure flight parameters, and automatically generate optimized flight paths with proper image overlap for successful 3D reconstruction.

### Key Capabilities

- **Interactive Map Interface**: Draw survey boundaries using rectangle, polygon, or circle tools.
- **Automated Path Generation**: Generate grid or orbit flight patterns with configurable spacing.
- **Camera Footprint Visualization**: Preview image coverage areas with drone-specific FOV calculations.
- **Professional Photogrammetry Settings**: Separate front and side overlap controls.
- **Mission Export**: Export missions as KMZ files compatible with DJI drones.
- **Mission Import**: Import existing KML/KMZ files for editing.
- **Flight Safety**: Automatic warnings for missions exceeding drone battery limits.

## ✨ Features

### Path Generation
- **Grid Pattern**: Automated lawnmower pattern with configurable angle.
- **Orbit Pattern**: Circular path around a point of interest.
- **Auto Direction**: Automatically align grid direction to longest boundary axis.
- **Path Optimization**: Straighten flight legs, reverse path direction.

### Camera & Imaging
- **Drone Presets**: Built-in profiles for DJI Mini 4 Pro, Mini 5 Pro, and Mavic 4 Pro.
- **Custom FOV**: Support for custom camera specifications.
- **Overlap Control**: Precise control over Side Overlap (flight line spacing) and Front Overlap (photo interval).
- **Waypoint Actions**: Configure shutter trigger, hovering, or continuous flight.

### Waypoint Management
- **Manual Waypoint Addition**: Click-to-add individual waypoints.
- **Drag & Drop**: Reposition waypoints by dragging (Hold Alt).
- **Bulk Editing**: Select multiple waypoints and edit properties simultaneously.
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history stack for mission editing.

### Visualization
- **Camera Footprint Overlay**: Display image coverage rectangles with rotation.
- **Color-Coded Footprints**: Visual differentiation using 4-color rotation.
- **Selection Highlighting**: Clearly identify selected waypoints.

## 🧮 Photogrammetry Math

**Side Overlap** (Line Spacing):
```
Line Spacing = Image Width × (1 - Side Overlap%)
```

**Front Overlap** (Photo Interval):
```
Waypoint Interval = Image Height × (1 - Front Overlap%)
```

**Ground Coverage**:
Calculated based on Altitude and Horizontal Field of View (HFOV).
